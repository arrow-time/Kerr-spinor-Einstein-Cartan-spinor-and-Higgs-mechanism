# Kerr spinor, Einstein-Cartan spinor and Higgs mechanism

 Section 10.10
 According to my personal understanding, the tensor description in standard General Relativity (GR) represents the compression and stretching of space in different directions. In fact, the synthesis of such compression-stretching tensors across different directions can generate structures similar to spinors, and the Kerr metric is essentially doing this kind of work.

 On the other hand, ECT (Einstein-Cartan Theory) directly introduces a spinor-defined connection corresponding to SEQ spin in this model.

In other words, the Kerr metric can be expressed using the tensors of standard GR, while the spinors in ECT are defined separately as part of the connection, and this connection can in fact be directly applied to the quantum spinor in quantum field theory.

 However, my understanding is that in order to unify General Relativity with quantum field theory, at the quantum level, SEQ spin must decouple from spatial elasticity(Section1); otherwise, mutual interference would contradict observed phenomena. Of course, ECT should mainly define the coupling between quantum spin and spatial tensors under high-energy conditions, while in low-energy states, it should still exhibit a behavior similar to such a decoupling.

 From the perspective of my personal proposed model, the combined effect of the Kerr metric and ECT actually corresponds to the essence of the Higgs mechanism, making it easier to describe how spatial spinors and fixed-chirality quantum spin lock spatial compression or stretching.

 The Higgs mechanism is akin to a chiral screw cap with a fixed handedness: only rotation in a specific direction can tighten and form a stable configuration, while reverse rotation fails to lock or sustain stability. This unidirectional locking behavior mirrors a "quantum chiral lock" â€” where the Higgs field couples selectively to the ground-state spin of Space Elementary Quanta (SEQ) with definite chirality, thereby stabilizing the structural matrix of matter particles while inducing intrinsic instability in that of antiparticles.
