# Kerr-spinor-Einstein-Cartan-spinor-and-Higgs-mechanism
From the perspective of my personal proposed model, the combined effect of the Kerr metric and ECT actually corresponds to the essence of the Higgs mechanism, making it easier to describe how spatial spinors and fixed-chirality quantum spin lock spatial compression or stretching.
